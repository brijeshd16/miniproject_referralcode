# miniproject_referralcode

# To get access to any chat group, one must have a unique referral code, which is associated to that group.


Steps to run this project on local system:
Unzip the project
Open terminal and navigate into the root folder of this project (inside miniproject_forum)
Run pip install -r requirements.txt (suggestion: run it on a separate virtual environment)
As I have included the database file(site.db), it already has data in it, so directly run the project. command: python .\wsgi.py
Open Chrome and put in URL localhost:5000
